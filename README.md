# DIGITILIZING-RECORD-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-IN-BARANGAY-POBLACION-SAN-PASCUAL

This is uses ionic framework and angular 

The contents of the codes are about barangay management system wherein residents can send registration request through mobile application
The residents can also send requests of barangay certificates and also blotter list 

The code isn't complete as it does not uses a database but the login functions works wherein the login will require validations
The same applies to the registration the registration button wont be applied if all fields are not complete

This includes codes such as swiper.js a new method of swiping in ionic 7 since the version of ionic to make this was 7
This also include loading components within the login so it will require the installation of ngrx modules together with the swiper modules

There is also an admin page wherein the request of registration are sent and can modify events and send events within the view-event tab happy coding :)

npm install @ngrx/store --save must also be installed
npm install @ngrx/store-devtools must be installed
npm install swiper@latest must also be installed
